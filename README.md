# Vibrations
Human Induced Vibrations Tool in Python

This tool was made for R4 and follows requirements from SB260.
More design parameters, criteria, ... + TMD design tool will be added in the future.

How to set up a new project: 
1. Log in the ney google account, go to google drive, copy the template folder and rename with your project name
2. On this page, open the notebook .ipynb
3. Click on the Collabs link to open the notebook in Google Collabs.
4. Click on File > Save a copy in drive.
5. In google drive, move this new file into your project folder.
--> you should have now in your folder a .ipynb file and 4 csv files.

How to calculate your project:
1. You need to replace the 4 csv files with the ones of your project. Make sure you keep the same format / digit separator, column header, etc. I will create some teddy templates to generate these files in an easier way.
2. Once your files are replaced, run the cells one after each other. Make sure to change the file paths of your csv files, check design parameters etc.
